# Workflow and repeatability discussion

See CTB's [Mar 2016 workshop on "repeatability"](https://2016-oslo-repeatability.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - in sum,

* write down and save the set of software loading or installation
  commands you use;

* you should always use version control (e.g. git) to track any custom
  processing scripts or commands;
  
* record any long-running scripts or commands that you use, and make it
  easy to (re)run them, using either shell scripts or 'make' or some other
  workflow system;

* get as close to automating your data viz and figure generation as you can
  with (e.g.) RMarkdown or Jupyter Notebook;
  
Among other things, this provides a set of artifacts that can be sent
to your advisor, provided to your collaborators and (ultimately)
published with your publication.  Plus you won't have to remember what
you did - you'll have it written down!
